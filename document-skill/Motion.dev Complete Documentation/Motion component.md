# Motion component

Most React animations in Motion are powered by the <motion /> component.

```
<motion />
```

There's a motion component for every HTML and SVG element, for instance motion.div , motion.circle etc. It extends standard React components with animation props that run at up to 120fps - without triggering React re-renders.

```
motion
```

```
motion.div
```

```
motion.circle
```

## Usage

Import motion from Motion:

```
motion
```

```
// React import { motion } from "motion/react" // React Server Components (Next.js etc) import * as motion from "motion/react-client"
```

You can use a motion component exactly as you would any normal HTML/SVG component:

```
motion
```

```
< motion . div className = "box" />
```

But you also gain access to powerful animation APIs like the animate , layout , whileInView props.

```
animate
```

```
layout
```

```
whileInView
```

```
< motion . div className = "box" // Animate when this value changes: animate = { { scale : 2 } } // Fade in when the element enters the viewport: whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } // Animate the component when its layout changes: layout // Style now supports indepedent transforms: style = { { x : 100 } } />
```

Building with AI? The Motion Studio MCP gives your AI editor access to the latest docs and source code of 330+ examples.

### Performance

motion components bypass React's render cycle entirely. Animated values update on every frame via the browser's native animation pipeline, so even complex animations with dozens of animated properties won't cause React re-renders or style/layout thrashing.

```
motion
```

Using motion values instead of React state to update style will also avoid re-renders.

```
style
```

```
const x = useMotionValue ( 0 ) useEffect ( ( ) => { // Won't trigger a re-render! const timeout = setTimeout ( ( ) => x . set ( 100 ) , 1000 ) return ( ) => clearTimeout ( timeout ) } , [ ] ) return < motion . div style = { { x } } />
```

### Server-side rendering

motion components are fully compatible with server-side rendering, meaning the initial state of the component will be reflected in the server-generated output.

```
motion
```

```
// Server will output `translateX(100px)` < motion . div initial = { false } animate = { { x : 100 } } />
```

### Custom components

You can add motion capabilities to any React component with motion.create() . The returned component accepts all standard motion props ( animate , whileHover , drag , layout , etc.) alongside the original component's props.

```
motion.create()
```

```
animate
```

```
whileHover
```

```
drag
```

```
layout
```

```
const MotionComponent = motion . create ( Component )
```

Your component must pass a ref to the component you want to animate.

React 18: Use forwardRef to wrap the component and pass ref to the element you want to animate:

```
forwardRef
```

```
ref
```

```
const Component = React . forwardRef ( ( props , ref ) => { return < div ref = { ref } /> } )
```

React 19: React 19 can pass ref via props :

```
ref
```

```
props
```

```
const Component = ( props ) => { return < div ref = { props . ref } /> } )
```

Make sure not to call motion.create() within a React render function! This will make a new component every render, breaking your animations.

```
motion.create()
```

It's also possible to pass strings to motion.create , which will create custom DOM elements.

```
motion.create
```

```
// Will render <custom-element /> into HTML const MotionComponent = motion . create ( 'custom-element' )
```

By default, all motion props (like animate etc) are filtered out of the props forwarded to the provided component. By providing a forwardMotionProps config, the provided component will receive these props.

```
motion
```

```
animate
```

```
props
```

```
forwardMotionProps
```

```
motion . create ( Component , { forwardMotionProps : true } )
```

## Props

motion components accept the following props.

```
motion
```

### Animation

Motion provides declarative animation props like animate and exit . Learn more about React animations in Motion .

```
animate
```

```
exit
```

#### initial

```
initial
```

The initial visual state of the motion component.

```
motion
```

This can be set as an animation target:

```
< motion . section initial = { { opacity : 0 , x : 0 } } />
```

Variants:

```
< motion . li initial = "visible" />
```

```
< motion . div initial = { [ "visible" , "active" ] } />
```

Or set as false to disable the enter animation and initially render as the values found in animate .

```
false
```

```
animate
```

```
< motion . div initial = { false } animate = { { opacity : 0 } } />
```

#### animate

```
animate
```

A target to animate to on enter, and on update.

Can be set as an animation target:

```
< motion . div initial = { { boxShadow : "0px 0px #000" } } animate = { { boxShadow : "10px 10px #000" } } />
```

Or variants:

```
< motion . li animate = "visible" />
```

```
< motion . div initial = "hidden" animate = { [ "visible" , "active" ] } />
```

#### exit

```
exit
```

A target to animate to when a component is removed from the tree. Can be set either as an animation target, or variant.

Owing to React limitations, the component being removed must be a direct child of AnimatePresence to enable this animation.

```
AnimatePresence
```

#### transition

```
transition
```

The default transition for this component to use when an animation prop ( animate , whileHover etc) has no transition defined.

```
animate
```

```

```

### Drag

#### drag

```
drag
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Enable dragging for this element. Set true to drag in both directions. Set "x" or "y" to only drag in a specific direction.

```
true
```

```
"x"
```

```
"y"
```

```
< motion . div drag />
```

#### whileDrag

```
whileDrag
```

Animation state, or variant label, to perform a drag animation to while the hover gesture is active.

```
// As target < motion . div drag whileDrag = { { scale : 0.9 } } />
```

```
// As variants < motion . div drag whileDrag = "dragging" />
```

#### dragConstraints

```
dragConstraints
```

Applies constraints on the draggable area.

Set as an object of optional top , left , right , and bottom values, measured in pixels:

```
top
```

```
left
```

```
right
```

```
bottom
```

```
< motion . div drag = "x" dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } />
```

Or as a ref to another element to use its bounding box as the draggable constraints:

```
ref
```

```
const MyComponent = ( ) => { const constraintsRef = useRef ( null ) return ( < motion . div ref = { constraintsRef } > < motion . div drag dragConstraints = { constraintsRef } /> </ motion . div > ) }
```

#### dragSnapToOrigin

```
dragSnapToOrigin
```

Default: false

```
false
```

If true , the draggable element will animate back to its center/origin when released.

```
true
```

```
< motion . div drag dragSnapToOrigin />
```

#### dragElastic

```
dragElastic
```

Default: 0.5

```
0.5
```

The degree of movement allowed outside constraints. 0 = no movement, 1 = full movement.

```
0
```

```
1
```

Set to 0.5 by default. Can also be set as false to disable movement.

```
0.5
```

```
false
```

By passing an object of top / right / bottom / left , individual values can be set per constraint. Any missing values will be set to 0 .

```
top
```

```
right
```

```
bottom
```

```
left
```

```
0
```

```
< motion . div drag dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } dragElastic = { 0.2 } />
```

#### dragMomentum

```
dragMomentum
```

Default: true

```
true
```

Apply momentum from the pan gesture to the component when dragging finishes. Set to true by default.

```
true
```

```
< motion . div drag dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } dragMomentum = { false } />
```

#### dragTransition

```
dragTransition
```

Allows you to change dragging momentum transition. When releasing a draggable element, an animation with type "inertia" starts. The animation is based on your dragging velocity. This property allows you to customize it.

```
"inertia"
```

```
< motion . div drag dragTransition = { { bounceStiffness : 600 , bounceDamping : 10 } } />
```

#### dragDirectionLock

```
dragDirectionLock
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Locks drag direction into the soonest detected direction. For example, if the component is moved more on the x axis than y axis before the drag gesture kicks in, it will only drag on the x axis for the remainder of the gesture.

```
x
```

```
y
```

```
x
```

```
< motion . div drag dragDirectionLock />
```

#### dragPropagation

```
dragPropagation
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Allows drag gesture propagation to child components.

```
< motion . div drag = "x" dragPropagation />
```

#### dragControls

```
dragControls
```

Usually, dragging is initiated by pressing down on a component and moving it. For some use-cases, for instance clicking at an arbitrary point on a video scrubber, we might want to initiate dragging from a different component than the draggable one.

By creating a dragControls using the useDragControls hook , we can pass this into the draggable component's dragControls prop. It exposes a start method that can start dragging from pointer events on other components.

```
dragControls
```

```
useDragControls
```

```
dragControls
```

```
start
```

```
const dragControls = useDragControls ( ) function startDrag ( event ) { dragControls . start ( event , { snapToCursor : true } ) } return ( < > < div onPointerDown = { startDrag } /> < motion . div drag = "x" dragControls = { dragControls } /> </ > )
```

Given that by setting dragControls you are taking control of initiating the drag gesture, it is possible to disable the draggable element as the initiator by setting dragListener={false} .

```
dragControls
```

```
dragListener={false}
```

#### dragListener

```
dragListener
```

Determines whether to trigger the drag gesture from event listeners. If passing dragControls , setting this to false will ensure dragging can only be initiated by the controls, rather than a pointerdown event on the draggable element.

```
dragControls
```

```
false
```

```
pointerdown
```

#### onDrag

```
onDrag
```

Callback function that fires when the drag gesture is recognised on this element.

```
function onDrag ( event , info ) { console . log ( info . point . x , info . point . y ) } < motion . div drag onDrag = { onDrag } />
```

Pan and drag events are provided the origin PointerEvent as well as an object info that contains x and y point values for the following:

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
x
```

```
y
```

- point : Relative to the device or page.

point : Relative to the device or page.

```
point
```

- delta : Distance since the last event.

delta : Distance since the last event.

```
delta
```

- offset : Distance from the original event.

offset : Distance from the original event.

```
offset
```

- velocity : Current velocity of the pointer.

velocity : Current velocity of the pointer.

```
velocity
```

#### onDragStart

```
onDragStart
```

Callback function that fires when a drag gesture starts. Provided the triggering PointerEvent and info .

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
< motion . div drag onDragStart = { ( event , info ) => console . log ( info . delta . x ) } />
```

#### onDragEnd

```
onDragEnd
```

Callback function that fires when a drag gesture ends. Provided the triggering PointerEvent and info .

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
< motion . div drag onDragEnd = { ( event , info ) => console . log ( info . delta . x ) } />
```

#### onDirectionLock

```
onDirectionLock
```

Callback function that fires a drag direction is determined.

```
< motion . div drag dragDirectionLock onDirectionLock = { axis => console . log ( axis ) } />
```

### Gestures

#### propagate

```
propagate
```

Prevent children gestures from propagating to their parents. Currently only supports tap .

```
tap
```

```
< motion . div whileTap = { { scale : 2 } } > // Pressing this button won't fire the above scale animation < motion . button whileTap = { { opacity : 0.8 } } propagate = { { tap : false } } /> </ motion . div >
```

### Viewport

Learn more about scroll-triggered animations in React.

#### whileInView

```
whileInView
```

Target or variants to label to while the element is in view.

```
// As target < motion . div whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } />
```

```
// As variants < motion . div whileInView = "visible" />
```

#### viewport

```
viewport
```

Options to define how the element is tracked within the viewport.

```
< motion . section whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } viewport = { { once : true } } />
```

Available options:

- once : If true , once element enters the viewport it won't detect subsequent leave/enter events.

once : If true , once element enters the viewport it won't detect subsequent leave/enter events.

```
once
```

```
true
```

- root : The ref of an ancestor scrollable element to detect intersections with (instead of window ).

root : The ref of an ancestor scrollable element to detect intersections with (instead of window ).

```
root
```

```
ref
```

```
window
```

- margin : A margin to add to the viewport to change the detection area. Defaults to "0px" . Use multiple values to adjust top/right/bottom/left, e.g. "0px -20px 0px 100px" .

margin : A margin to add to the viewport to change the detection area. Defaults to "0px" . Use multiple values to adjust top/right/bottom/left, e.g. "0px -20px 0px 100px" .

```
margin
```

```
"0px"
```

```
"0px -20px 0px 100px"
```

- amount : The amount of an element that should enter the viewport to be considered "entered". Either "some" , "all" or a number between 0 and 1 . Defaults to "some" .

amount : The amount of an element that should enter the viewport to be considered "entered". Either "some" , "all" or a number between 0 and 1 . Defaults to "some" .

```
amount
```

```
"some"
```

```
"all"
```

```
0
```

```
1
```

```
"some"
```

#### onViewportEnter

```
onViewportEnter
```

Callback function that fires when an element enters the viewport. Provided the IntersectionObserverEntry with details of the intersection event.

```
IntersectionObserverEntry
```

```
< motion . div onViewportEnter = { ( entry ) => console . log ( entry . isIntersecting ) } />
```

#### onViewportLeave

```
onViewportLeave
```

Callback function that fires when an element enters the viewport. Provided the IntersectionObserverEntry with details of the intersection event.

```
IntersectionObserverEntry
```

```
< motion . div onViewportLeave = { ( entry ) => console . log ( entry . intersectionRect ) } />
```

### Layout

Learn more about layout animations in React.

#### layout

```
layout
```

Default: false

```
false
```

If true , this component will perform layout animations .

```
true
```

```
< motion . div layout />
```

If set to "position" or "size" , only its position or size will animate, respectively.

```
"position"
```

```
"size"
```

```
< motion . img layout = "position" />
```

#### layoutId

```
layoutId
```

If set, this component will animate changes to its layout. Additionally, when a new element enters the DOM and an element already exists with a matching layoutId , it will animate out from the previous element's size/position.

```
layoutId
```

```
{ items . map ( item => ( < motion . li layout > { item . name } { item . isSelected && < motion . div layoutId = "underline" /> } </ motion . li > ) ) }
```

If the previous component remains in the tree, the two elements will crossfade.

#### layoutDependency

```
layoutDependency
```

By default, layout changes are detected every render. To reduce measurements and thus improve performance, you can pass a layoutDependency prop. Measurements will only occur when this value changes.

```
layoutDependency
```

```
< motion . nav layout layoutDependency = { isOpen } />
```

### layoutAnchor

```
layoutAnchor
```

Default: { x: 0, y: 0 }

```
{ x: 0, y: 0 }
```

Motion's layout animations look correct when a parent and child animate with different transitions, because it resolves the child's position relative to its parent.

By default, it does this using the top/left of the parent. layoutAnchor can customise this point, where x and y can be set as independent progress values between 0 and 1 .

```
layoutAnchor
```

```
x
```

```
y
```

```
0
```

```
1
```

- 0 = top/left

0 = top/left

```
0
```

- 0.5 = center

0.5 = center

```
0.5
```

- 1 = bottom/right

1 = bottom/right

```
1
```

Setting to false disables relative projection for this element, and elements will animate relative to their page-relative change.

```
false
```

```
< motion . ul layout > < motion . li layout layoutAnchor = { { x : 1 , y : 0 } } transition = { { delay : 1 } } /> </ motion . ul >
```

#### layoutScroll

```
layoutScroll
```

For layout animations to work correctly within scrollable elements, their scroll offset needs measuring. For performance reasons, Framer Motion doesn't measure the scroll offset of every ancestor. Add the layoutScroll prop to elements that should be measured.

```
layoutScroll
```

```
< motion . div layoutScroll style = { { overflow : "scroll" } } > < motion . div layout /> </ motion . div >
```

#### layoutRoot

```
layoutRoot
```

For layout animations to work correctly within position: fixed elements, we need to account for page scroll. Add layoutRoot to mark an element as position: fixed .

```
position: fixed
```

```
layoutRoot
```

```
position: fixed
```

```
< motion . div layoutRoot style = { { position : "fixed" } } > < motion . div layout /> </ motion . div >
```

#### onLayoutAnimationStart

```
onLayoutAnimationStart
```

A callback to run when a layout animation starts.

#### onLayoutAnimationComplete

```
onLayoutAnimationComplete
```

A callback to run when a layout animation completes.

### Advanced

#### inherit

```
inherit
```

Set to false to prevent a component inheriting or propagating changes in a parent variant.

```
false
```

#### custom

```
custom
```

Custom data to pass through to dynamic variants.

```
const variants = { visible : ( custom ) => ( { opacity : 1 , transition : { delay : custom * 0.2 } } ) } return ( < motion . ul animate = "visible" > < motion . li custom = { 0 } variants = { variants } /> < motion . li custom = { 1 } variants = { variants } /> < motion . li custom = { 2 } variants = { variants } /> </ motion . ul > )
```

#### transformTemplate

```
transformTemplate
```

By default, transforms are applied in order of translate , scale , rotate and skew .

```
translate
```

```
scale
```

```
rotate
```

```
skew
```

To change this, transformTemplate can be set as a function that accepts the latest transforms and the generated transform string and returns a new transform string.

```
transformTemplate
```

```
// Use the latest transform values < motion . div style = { { x : 0 , rotate : 180 } } transformTemplate = { ( { x , rotate } ) => `rotate( ${ rotate } deg) translateX( ${ x } px)` } />

```
// Or the generated transform string < motion . div style = { { x : 0 , rotate : 180 } } transformTemplate = { ( latest , generated ) => `translate(-50%, -50%) ${ generated } ` } />
```

## FAQs

What is the <motion /> component?

<motion /> is a drop-in replacement for HTML and SVG elements that adds animation capabilities. Instead of writing <div>, you write <motion.div>. The element behaves identically but can now accept animation props like animate, whileHover, and transition.

How do I animate an element in React with Motion?

Pass an animate prop to any <motion /> component with the values you want to animate to. For example, <motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} /> will animate opacity from its current value to 1. Motion automatically detects changes and animates between them.

Does <motion /> affect performance?

<motion /> is optimised to animate transform and opacity on the compositor thread wherever possible, avoiding layout and paint. For best performance, prefer animating transform and opacity over properties like width or top.

Can I use <motion /> with custom components?

Yes. Use motion.create() to wrap any component that forwards its ref and accepts a style prop. For example: const MotionButton = motion.create(Button).

Most React animations in Motion are powered by the <motion /> component.

```
<motion />
```

There's a motion component for every HTML and SVG element, for instance motion.div , motion.circle etc. It extends standard React components with animation props that run at up to 120fps - without triggering React re-renders.

```
motion
```

```
motion.div
```

```
motion.circle
```

## Usage

Import motion from Motion:

```
motion
```

```
// React import { motion } from "motion/react" // React Server Components (Next.js etc) import * as motion from "motion/react-client"
```

You can use a motion component exactly as you would any normal HTML/SVG component:

```
motion
```

```
< motion . div className = "box" />
```

But you also gain access to powerful animation APIs like the animate , layout , whileInView props.

```
animate
```

```
layout
```

```
whileInView
```

```
< motion . div className = "box" // Animate when this value changes: animate = { { scale : 2 } } // Fade in when the element enters the viewport: whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } // Animate the component when its layout changes: layout // Style now supports indepedent transforms: style = { { x : 100 } } />
```

### Performance

motion components bypass React's render cycle entirely. Animated values update on every frame via the browser's native animation pipeline, so even complex animations with dozens of animated properties won't cause React re-renders or style/layout thrashing.

```
motion
```

Using motion values instead of React state to update style will also avoid re-renders.

```
style
```

```
const x = useMotionValue ( 0 ) useEffect ( ( ) => { // Won't trigger a re-render! const timeout = setTimeout ( ( ) => x . set ( 100 ) , 1000 ) return ( ) => clearTimeout ( timeout ) } , [ ] ) return < motion . div style = { { x } } />
```

### Server-side rendering

motion components are fully compatible with server-side rendering, meaning the initial state of the component will be reflected in the server-generated output.

```
motion
```

```
// Server will output `translateX(100px)` < motion . div initial = { false } animate = { { x : 100 } } />
```

### Custom components

You can add motion capabilities to any React component with motion.create() . The returned component accepts all standard motion props ( animate , whileHover , drag , layout , etc.) alongside the original component's props.

```
motion.create()
```

```
animate
```

```
whileHover
```

```
drag
```

```
layout
```

```
const MotionComponent = motion . create ( Component )
```

Your component must pass a ref to the component you want to animate.

React 18: Use forwardRef to wrap the component and pass ref to the element you want to animate:

```
forwardRef
```

```
ref
```

```
const Component = React . forwardRef ( ( props , ref ) => { return < div ref = { ref } /> } )
```

React 19: React 19 can pass ref via props :

```
ref
```

```
props
```

```
const Component = ( props ) => { return < div ref = { props . ref } /> } )
```

Make sure not to call motion.create() within a React render function! This will make a new component every render, breaking your animations.

```
motion.create()
```

It's also possible to pass strings to motion.create , which will create custom DOM elements.

```
motion.create
```

```
// Will render <custom-element /> into HTML const MotionComponent = motion . create ( 'custom-element' )
```

By default, all motion props (like animate etc) are filtered out of the props forwarded to the provided component. By providing a forwardMotionProps config, the provided component will receive these props.

```
motion
```

```
animate
```

```
props
```

```
forwardMotionProps
```

```
motion . create ( Component , { forwardMotionProps : true } )
```

```

#### exit

```
exit
```

A target to animate to when a component is removed from the tree. Can be set either as an animation target, or variant.

Owing to React limitations, the component being removed must be a direct child of AnimatePresence to enable this animation.

```

### Drag

#### drag

```
drag
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Enable dragging for this element. Set true to drag in both directions. Set "x" or "y" to only drag in a specific direction.

```
true
```

```
"x"
```

```
"y"
```

```
< motion . div drag />
```

#### whileDrag

```
whileDrag
```

Animation state, or variant label, to perform a drag animation to while the hover gesture is active.

```
// As target < motion . div drag whileDrag = { { scale : 0.9 } } />
```

```
// As variants < motion . div drag whileDrag = "dragging" />
```

#### dragConstraints

```
dragConstraints
```

Applies constraints on the draggable area.

Set as an object of optional top , left , right , and bottom values, measured in pixels:

```
top
```

```
left
```

```
right
```

```
bottom
```

```
< motion . div drag = "x" dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } />
```

Or as a ref to another element to use its bounding box as the draggable constraints:

```
ref
```

```
const MyComponent = ( ) => { const constraintsRef = useRef ( null ) return ( < motion . div ref = { constraintsRef } > < motion . div drag dragConstraints = { constraintsRef } /> </ motion . div > ) }
```

#### dragSnapToOrigin

```
dragSnapToOrigin
```

Default: false

```
false
```

If true , the draggable element will animate back to its center/origin when released.

```
true
```

```
< motion . div drag dragSnapToOrigin />
```

#### dragElastic

```
dragElastic
```

Default: 0.5

```
0.5
```

The degree of movement allowed outside constraints. 0 = no movement, 1 = full movement.

```
0
```

```
1
```

Set to 0.5 by default. Can also be set as false to disable movement.

```
0.5
```

```
false
```

By passing an object of top / right / bottom / left , individual values can be set per constraint. Any missing values will be set to 0 .

```
top
```

```
right
```

```
bottom
```

```
left
```

```
0
```

```
< motion . div drag dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } dragElastic = { 0.2 } />
```

#### dragMomentum

```
dragMomentum
```

Default: true

```
true
```

Apply momentum from the pan gesture to the component when dragging finishes. Set to true by default.

```
true
```

```
< motion . div drag dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } dragMomentum = { false } />
```

#### dragTransition

```
dragTransition
```

Allows you to change dragging momentum transition. When releasing a draggable element, an animation with type "inertia" starts. The animation is based on your dragging velocity. This property allows you to customize it.

```
"inertia"
```

```
< motion . div drag dragTransition = { { bounceStiffness : 600 , bounceDamping : 10 } } />
```

#### dragDirectionLock

```
dragDirectionLock
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Locks drag direction into the soonest detected direction. For example, if the component is moved more on the x axis than y axis before the drag gesture kicks in, it will only drag on the x axis for the remainder of the gesture.

```
x
```

```
y
```

```
x
```

```
< motion . div drag dragDirectionLock />
```

#### dragPropagation

```
dragPropagation
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Allows drag gesture propagation to child components.

```
< motion . div drag = "x" dragPropagation />
```

#### dragControls

```
dragControls
```

Usually, dragging is initiated by pressing down on a component and moving it. For some use-cases, for instance clicking at an arbitrary point on a video scrubber, we might want to initiate dragging from a different component than the draggable one.

By creating a dragControls using the useDragControls hook , we can pass this into the draggable component's dragControls prop. It exposes a start method that can start dragging from pointer events on other components.

```
dragControls
```

```
useDragControls
```

```
dragControls
```

```
start
```

```
const dragControls = useDragControls ( ) function startDrag ( event ) { dragControls . start ( event , { snapToCursor : true } ) } return ( < > < div onPointerDown = { startDrag } /> < motion . div drag = "x" dragControls = { dragControls } /> </ > )
```

Given that by setting dragControls you are taking control of initiating the drag gesture, it is possible to disable the draggable element as the initiator by setting dragListener={false} .

```
dragControls
```

```
dragListener={false}
```

#### dragListener

```
dragListener
```

Determines whether to trigger the drag gesture from event listeners. If passing dragControls , setting this to false will ensure dragging can only be initiated by the controls, rather than a pointerdown event on the draggable element.

```
dragControls
```

```
false
```

```
pointerdown
```

#### onDrag

```
onDrag
```

Callback function that fires when the drag gesture is recognised on this element.

```
function onDrag ( event , info ) { console . log ( info . point . x , info . point . y ) } < motion . div drag onDrag = { onDrag } />
```

Pan and drag events are provided the origin PointerEvent as well as an object info that contains x and y point values for the following:

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
x
```

```
y
```

- point : Relative to the device or page.

point : Relative to the device or page.

```

```

- offset : Distance from the original event.

offset : Distance from the original event.

```

```

```
< motion . div drag onDragStart = { ( event , info ) => console . log ( info . delta . x ) } />
```

#### onDragEnd

```
onDragEnd
```

Callback function that fires when a drag gesture ends. Provided the triggering PointerEvent and info .

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
< motion . div drag onDragEnd = { ( event , info ) => console . log ( info . delta . x ) } />
```

#### onDirectionLock

```
onDirectionLock
```

Callback function that fires a drag direction is determined.

```
< motion . div drag dragDirectionLock onDirectionLock = { axis => console . log ( axis ) } />
```

### Gestures

#### propagate

```
propagate
```

Prevent children gestures from propagating to their parents. Currently only supports tap .

```
tap
```

```
< motion . div whileTap = { { scale : 2 } } > // Pressing this button won't fire the above scale animation < motion . button whileTap = { { opacity : 0.8 } } propagate = { { tap : false } } /> </ motion . div >
```

### Viewport

Learn more about scroll-triggered animations in React.

#### whileInView

```
whileInView
```

Target or variants to label to while the element is in view.

```
// As target < motion . div whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } />
```

```
// As variants < motion . div whileInView = "visible" />
```

#### viewport

```
viewport
```

Options to define how the element is tracked within the viewport.

```
< motion . section whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } viewport = { { once : true } } />
```

Available options:

- once : If true , once element enters the viewport it won't detect subsequent leave/enter events.

once : If true , once element enters the viewport it won't detect subsequent leave/enter events.

```
once
```

```
true
```

- root : The ref of an ancestor scrollable element to detect intersections with (instead of window ).

root : The ref of an ancestor scrollable element to detect intersections with (instead of window ).

```
root
```

```
ref
```

```
window
```

- margin : A margin to add to the viewport to change the detection area. Defaults to "0px" . Use multiple values to adjust top/right/bottom/left, e.g. "0px -20px 0px 100px" .

margin : A margin to add to the viewport to change the detection area. Defaults to "0px" . Use multiple values to adjust top/right/bottom/left, e.g. "0px -20px 0px 100px" .

```
margin
```

```
"0px"
```

```
"0px -20px 0px 100px"
```

- amount : The amount of an element that should enter the viewport to be considered "entered". Either "some" , "all" or a number between 0 and 1 . Defaults to "some" .

amount : The amount of an element that should enter the viewport to be considered "entered". Either "some" , "all" or a number between 0 and 1 . Defaults to "some" .

```
amount
```

```
"some"
```

```
"all"
```

```
0
```

```
1
```

```
"some"
```

#### onViewportEnter

```
onViewportEnter
```

Callback function that fires when an element enters the viewport. Provided the IntersectionObserverEntry with details of the intersection event.

```
IntersectionObserverEntry
```

```
< motion . div onViewportEnter = { ( entry ) => console . log ( entry . isIntersecting ) } />
```

#### onViewportLeave

```
onViewportLeave
```

Callback function that fires when an element enters the viewport. Provided the IntersectionObserverEntry with details of the intersection event.

```
IntersectionObserverEntry
```

```
< motion . div onViewportLeave = { ( entry ) => console . log ( entry . intersectionRect ) } />
```

### Layout

Learn more about layout animations in React.

#### layout

```
layout
```

Default: false

```
false
```

If true , this component will perform layout animations .

```
true
```

```
< motion . div layout />
```

If set to "position" or "size" , only its position or size will animate, respectively.

```
"position"
```

```
"size"
```

```
< motion . img layout = "position" />
```

#### layoutId

```
layoutId
```

If set, this component will animate changes to its layout. Additionally, when a new element enters the DOM and an element already exists with a matching layoutId , it will animate out from the previous element's size/position.

```
layoutId
```

```
{ items . map ( item => ( < motion . li layout > { item . name } { item . isSelected && < motion . div layoutId = "underline" /> } </ motion . li > ) ) }
```

If the previous component remains in the tree, the two elements will crossfade.

#### layoutDependency

```
layoutDependency
```

By default, layout changes are detected every render. To reduce measurements and thus improve performance, you can pass a layoutDependency prop. Measurements will only occur when this value changes.

```
layoutDependency
```

```
< motion . nav layout layoutDependency = { isOpen } />
```

### layoutAnchor

```
layoutAnchor
```

Default: { x: 0, y: 0 }

```
{ x: 0, y: 0 }
```

Motion's layout animations look correct when a parent and child animate with different transitions, because it resolves the child's position relative to its parent.

By default, it does this using the top/left of the parent. layoutAnchor can customise this point, where x and y can be set as independent progress values between 0 and 1 .

```
layoutAnchor
```

```
x
```

```
y
```

```
0
```

```
1
```

- 0 = top/left

0 = top/left

```
0
```

- 0.5 = center

0.5 = center

```
0.5
```

- 1 = bottom/right

1 = bottom/right

```
1
```

Setting to false disables relative projection for this element, and elements will animate relative to their page-relative change.

```
false
```

```
< motion . ul layout > < motion . li layout layoutAnchor = { { x : 1 , y : 0 } } transition = { { delay : 1 } } /> </ motion . ul >
```

#### layoutScroll

```
layoutScroll
```

For layout animations to work correctly within scrollable elements, their scroll offset needs measuring. For performance reasons, Framer Motion doesn't measure the scroll offset of every ancestor. Add the layoutScroll prop to elements that should be measured.

```
layoutScroll
```

```
< motion . div layoutScroll style = { { overflow : "scroll" } } > < motion . div layout /> </ motion . div >
```

#### layoutRoot

```
layoutRoot
```

For layout animations to work correctly within position: fixed elements, we need to account for page scroll. Add layoutRoot to mark an element as position: fixed .

```
position: fixed
```

```
layoutRoot
```

```
position: fixed
```

```
< motion . div layoutRoot style = { { position : "fixed" } } > < motion . div layout /> </ motion . div >
```

#### onLayoutAnimationStart

```
onLayoutAnimationStart
```

A callback to run when a layout animation starts.

#### onLayoutAnimationComplete

```
onLayoutAnimationComplete
```

A callback to run when a layout animation completes.

### Advanced

#### inherit

```
inherit
```

Set to false to prevent a component inheriting or propagating changes in a parent variant.

```
false
```

#### custom

```
custom
```

Custom data to pass through to dynamic variants.

```
const variants = { visible : ( custom ) => ( { opacity : 1 , transition : { delay : custom * 0.2 } } ) } return ( < motion . ul animate = "visible" > < motion . li custom = { 0 } variants = { variants } /> < motion . li custom = { 1 } variants = { variants } /> < motion . li custom = { 2 } variants = { variants } /> </ motion . ul > )
```

#### transformTemplate

```
transformTemplate
```

By default, transforms are applied in order of translate , scale , rotate and skew .

```
translate
```

```
scale
```

```
rotate
```

```
skew
```

To change this, transformTemplate can be set as a function that accepts the latest transforms and the generated transform string and returns a new transform string.

```
transformTemplate
```

```
// Use the latest transform values < motion . div style = { { x : 0 , rotate : 180 } } transformTemplate = { ( { x , rotate } ) => `rotate( ${ rotate } deg) translateX( ${ x } px)` } />
```

```
// Or the generated transform string < motion . div style = { { x : 0 , rotate : 180 } } transformTemplate = { ( latest , generated ) => `translate(-50%, -50%) ${ generated } ` } />
```

## FAQs

What is the <motion /> component?

<motion /> is a drop-in replacement for HTML and SVG elements that adds animation capabilities. Instead of writing <div>, you write <motion.div>. The element behaves identically but can now accept animation props like animate, whileHover, and transition.

How do I animate an element in React with Motion?

Pass an animate prop to any <motion /> component with the values you want to animate to. For example, <motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} /> will animate opacity from its current value to 1. Motion automatically detects changes and animates between them.

Does <motion /> affect performance?

<motion /> is optimised to animate transform and opacity on the compositor thread wherever possible, avoiding layout and paint. For best performance, prefer animating transform and opacity over properties like width or top.

Can I use <motion /> with custom components?

Yes. Use motion.create() to wrap any component that forwards its ref and accepts a style prop. For example: const MotionButton = motion.create(Button).

Most React animations in Motion are powered by the <motion /> component.

```
<motion />
```

There's a motion component for every HTML and SVG element, for instance motion.div , motion.circle etc. It extends standard React components with animation props that run at up to 120fps - without triggering React re-renders.

```
motion
```

```
motion.div
```

```
motion.circle
```

## Usage

Import motion from Motion:

```
motion
```

```
// React import { motion } from "motion/react" // React Server Components (Next.js etc) import * as motion from "motion/react-client"
```

You can use a motion component exactly as you would any normal HTML/SVG component:

```
motion
```

```
< motion . div className = "box" />
```

But you also gain access to powerful animation APIs like the animate , layout , whileInView props.

```
animate
```

```
layout
```

```
whileInView
```

```
< motion . div className = "box" // Animate when this value changes: animate = { { scale : 2 } } // Fade in when the element enters the viewport: whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } // Animate the component when its layout changes: layout // Style now supports indepedent transforms: style = { { x : 100 } } />
```

### Performance

motion components bypass React's render cycle entirely. Animated values update on every frame via the browser's native animation pipeline, so even complex animations with dozens of animated properties won't cause React re-renders or style/layout thrashing.

```
motion
```

Using motion values instead of React state to update style will also avoid re-renders.

```
style
```

```
const x = useMotionValue ( 0 ) useEffect ( ( ) => { // Won't trigger a re-render! const timeout = setTimeout ( ( ) => x . set ( 100 ) , 1000 ) return ( ) => clearTimeout ( timeout ) } , [ ] ) return < motion . div style = { { x } } />
```

### Server-side rendering

motion components are fully compatible with server-side rendering, meaning the initial state of the component will be reflected in the server-generated output.

```
motion
```

```
// Server will output `translateX(100px)` < motion . div initial = { false } animate = { { x : 100 } } />
```

### Custom components

You can add motion capabilities to any React component with motion.create() . The returned component accepts all standard motion props ( animate , whileHover , drag , layout , etc.) alongside the original component's props.

```
motion.create()
```

```
animate
```

```
whileHover
```

```
drag
```

```
layout
```

```
const MotionComponent = motion . create ( Component )
```

Your component must pass a ref to the component you want to animate.

React 18: Use forwardRef to wrap the component and pass ref to the element you want to animate:

```
forwardRef
```

```
ref
```

```
const Component = React . forwardRef ( ( props , ref ) => { return < div ref = { ref } /> } )
```

React 19: React 19 can pass ref via props :

```
ref
```

```
props
```

```
const Component = ( props ) => { return < div ref = { props . ref } /> } )
```

Make sure not to call motion.create() within a React render function! This will make a new component every render, breaking your animations.

```
motion.create()
```

It's also possible to pass strings to motion.create , which will create custom DOM elements.

```
motion.create
```

```
// Will render <custom-element /> into HTML const MotionComponent = motion . create ( 'custom-element' )
```

By default, all motion props (like animate etc) are filtered out of the props forwarded to the provided component. By providing a forwardMotionProps config, the provided component will receive these props.

```
motion
```

```
animate
```

```
props
```

```
forwardMotionProps
```

```
motion . create ( Component , { forwardMotionProps : true } )
```

```

#### exit

```
exit
```

A target to animate to when a component is removed from the tree. Can be set either as an animation target, or variant.

Owing to React limitations, the component being removed must be a direct child of AnimatePresence to enable this animation.

```

### Drag

#### drag

```
drag
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Enable dragging for this element. Set true to drag in both directions. Set "x" or "y" to only drag in a specific direction.

```
true
```

```
"x"
```

```
"y"
```

```
< motion . div drag />
```

#### whileDrag

```
whileDrag
```

Animation state, or variant label, to perform a drag animation to while the hover gesture is active.

```
// As target < motion . div drag whileDrag = { { scale : 0.9 } } />
```

```
// As variants < motion . div drag whileDrag = "dragging" />
```

#### dragConstraints

```
dragConstraints
```

Applies constraints on the draggable area.

Set as an object of optional top , left , right , and bottom values, measured in pixels:

```
top
```

```
left
```

```
right
```

```
bottom
```

```
< motion . div drag = "x" dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } />
```

Or as a ref to another element to use its bounding box as the draggable constraints:

```
ref
```

```
const MyComponent = ( ) => { const constraintsRef = useRef ( null ) return ( < motion . div ref = { constraintsRef } > < motion . div drag dragConstraints = { constraintsRef } /> </ motion . div > ) }
```

#### dragSnapToOrigin

```
dragSnapToOrigin
```

Default: false

```
false
```

If true , the draggable element will animate back to its center/origin when released.

```
true
```

```
< motion . div drag dragSnapToOrigin />
```

#### dragElastic

```
dragElastic
```

Default: 0.5

```
0.5
```

The degree of movement allowed outside constraints. 0 = no movement, 1 = full movement.

```
0
```

```
1
```

Set to 0.5 by default. Can also be set as false to disable movement.

```
0.5
```

```
false
```

By passing an object of top / right / bottom / left , individual values can be set per constraint. Any missing values will be set to 0 .

```
top
```

```
right
```

```
bottom
```

```
left
```

```
0
```

```
< motion . div drag dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } dragElastic = { 0.2 } />
```

#### dragMomentum

```
dragMomentum
```

Default: true

```
true
```

Apply momentum from the pan gesture to the component when dragging finishes. Set to true by default.

```
true
```

```
< motion . div drag dragConstraints = { { left : 0 , right : 300 } } dragMomentum = { false } />
```

#### dragTransition

```
dragTransition
```

Allows you to change dragging momentum transition. When releasing a draggable element, an animation with type "inertia" starts. The animation is based on your dragging velocity. This property allows you to customize it.

```
"inertia"
```

```
< motion . div drag dragTransition = { { bounceStiffness : 600 , bounceDamping : 10 } } />
```

#### dragDirectionLock

```
dragDirectionLock
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Locks drag direction into the soonest detected direction. For example, if the component is moved more on the x axis than y axis before the drag gesture kicks in, it will only drag on the x axis for the remainder of the gesture.

```
x
```

```
y
```

```
x
```

```
< motion . div drag dragDirectionLock />
```

#### dragPropagation

```
dragPropagation
```

Default: false

```
false
```

Allows drag gesture propagation to child components.

```
< motion . div drag = "x" dragPropagation />
```

#### dragControls

```
dragControls
```

Usually, dragging is initiated by pressing down on a component and moving it. For some use-cases, for instance clicking at an arbitrary point on a video scrubber, we might want to initiate dragging from a different component than the draggable one.

By creating a dragControls using the useDragControls hook , we can pass this into the draggable component's dragControls prop. It exposes a start method that can start dragging from pointer events on other components.

```
dragControls
```

```
useDragControls
```

```
dragControls
```

```
start
```

```
const dragControls = useDragControls ( ) function startDrag ( event ) { dragControls . start ( event , { snapToCursor : true } ) } return ( < > < div onPointerDown = { startDrag } /> < motion . div drag = "x" dragControls = { dragControls } /> </ > )
```

Given that by setting dragControls you are taking control of initiating the drag gesture, it is possible to disable the draggable element as the initiator by setting dragListener={false} .

```
dragControls
```

```
dragListener={false}
```

#### dragListener

```
dragListener
```

Determines whether to trigger the drag gesture from event listeners. If passing dragControls , setting this to false will ensure dragging can only be initiated by the controls, rather than a pointerdown event on the draggable element.

```
dragControls
```

```
false
```

```
pointerdown
```

#### onDrag

```
onDrag
```

Callback function that fires when the drag gesture is recognised on this element.

```
function onDrag ( event , info ) { console . log ( info . point . x , info . point . y ) } < motion . div drag onDrag = { onDrag } />
```

Pan and drag events are provided the origin PointerEvent as well as an object info that contains x and y point values for the following:

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
x
```

```
y
```

- point : Relative to the device or page.

point : Relative to the device or page.

```

```

- delta : Distance since the last event.

delta : Distance since the last event.

```

```

- offset : Distance from the original event.

offset : Distance from the original event.

```

```

- velocity : Current velocity of the pointer.

velocity : Current velocity of the pointer.

```
velocity
```

#### onDragStart

```

```

```
< motion . div drag onDragStart = { ( event , info ) => console . log ( info . delta . x ) } />
```

#### onDragEnd

```
onDragEnd
```

Callback function that fires when a drag gesture ends. Provided the triggering PointerEvent and info .

```
PointerEvent
```

```
info
```

```
< motion . div drag onDragEnd = { ( event , info ) => console . log ( info . delta . x ) } />
```

#### onDirectionLock

```
onDirectionLock
```

Callback function that fires a drag direction is determined.

```
< motion . div drag dragDirectionLock onDirectionLock = { axis => console . log ( axis ) } />
```

### Gestures

#### propagate

```
propagate
```

Prevent children gestures from propagating to their parents. Currently only supports tap .

```
tap
```

```
< motion . div whileTap = { { scale : 2 } } > // Pressing this button won't fire the above scale animation < motion . button whileTap = { { opacity : 0.8 } } propagate = { { tap : false } } /> </ motion . div >
```

### Viewport

Learn more about scroll-triggered animations in React.

#### whileInView

```
whileInView
```

Target or variants to label to while the element is in view.

```
// As target < motion . div whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } />
```

```
// As variants < motion . div whileInView = "visible" />
```

#### viewport

```
viewport
```

Options to define how the element is tracked within the viewport.

```
< motion . section whileInView = { { opacity : 1 } } viewport = { { once : true } } />
```

Available options:

- once : If true , once element enters the viewport it won't detect subsequent leave/enter events.

once : If true , once element enters the viewport it won't detect subsequent leave/enter events.

```
once
```

```
true
```

- root : The ref of an ancestor scrollable element to detect intersections with (instead of window ).

root : The ref of an ancestor scrollable element to detect intersections with (instead of window ).

```
root
```

```
ref
```

```
window
```

- margin : A margin to add to the viewport to change the detection area. Defaults to "0px" . Use multiple values to adjust top/right/bottom/left, e.g. "0px -20px 0px 100px" .

margin : A margin to add to the viewport to change the detection area. Defaults to "0px" . Use multiple values to adjust top/right/bottom/left, e.g. "0px -20px 0px 100px" .

```
margin
```

```
"0px"
```

```
"0px -20px 0px 100px"
```

- amount : The amount of an element that should enter the viewport to be considered "entered". Either "some" , "all" or a number between 0 and 1 . Defaults to "some" .

amount : The amount of an element that should enter the viewport to be considered "entered". Either "some" , "all" or a number between 0 and 1 . Defaults to "some" .

```
amount
```

```
"some"
```

```
"all"
```

```
0
```

```
1
```

```
"some"
```

#### onViewportEnter

```
onViewportEnter
```

Callback function that fires when an element enters the viewport. Provided the IntersectionObserverEntry with details of the intersection event.

```
IntersectionObserverEntry
```

```
< motion . div onViewportEnter = { ( entry ) => console . log ( entry . isIntersecting ) } />
```

#### onViewportLeave

```
onViewportLeave
```

Callback function that fires when an element enters the viewport. Provided the IntersectionObserverEntry with details of the intersection event.

```
IntersectionObserverEntry
```

```
< motion . div onViewportLeave = { ( entry ) => console . log ( entry . intersectionRect ) } />
```

### Layout

Learn more about layout animations in React.

#### layout

```
layout
```

Default: false

```
false
```

If true , this component will perform layout animations .

```
true
```

```
< motion . div layout />
```

If set to "position" or "size" , only its position or size will animate, respectively.

```
"position"
```

```
"size"
```

```
< motion . img layout = "position" />
```

#### layoutId

```
layoutId
```

If set, this component will animate changes to its layout. Additionally, when a new element enters the DOM and an element already exists with a matching layoutId , it will animate out from the previous element's size/position.

```
layoutId
```

```
{ items . map ( item => ( < motion . li layout > { item . name } { item . isSelected && < motion . div layoutId = "underline" /> } </ motion . li > ) ) }
```

If the previous component remains in the tree, the two elements will crossfade.

#### layoutDependency

```
layoutDependency
```

By default, layout changes are detected every render. To reduce measurements and thus improve performance, you can pass a layoutDependency prop. Measurements will only occur when this value changes.

```
layoutDependency
```

```
< motion . nav layout layoutDependency = { isOpen } />
```

### layoutAnchor

```
layoutAnchor
```

Default: { x: 0, y: 0 }

```
{ x: 0, y: 0 }
```

Motion's layout animations look correct when a parent and child animate with different transitions, because it resolves the child's position relative to its parent.

By default, it does this using the top/left of the parent. layoutAnchor can customise this point, where x and y can be set as independent progress values between 0 and 1 .

```
layoutAnchor
```

```
x
```

```
y
```

```
0
```

```
1
```

- 0 = top/left

0 = top/left

```
0
```

- 0.5 = center

0.5 = center

```
0.5
```

- 1 = bottom/right

1 = bottom/right

```
1
```

Setting to false disables relative projection for this element, and elements will animate relative to their page-relative change.

```
false
```

```
< motion . ul layout > < motion . li layout layoutAnchor = { { x : 1 , y : 0 } } transition = { { delay : 1 } } /> </ motion . ul >
```

#### layoutScroll

```
layoutScroll
```

For layout animations to work correctly within scrollable elements, their scroll offset needs measuring. For performance reasons, Framer Motion doesn't measure the scroll offset of every ancestor. Add the layoutScroll prop to elements that should be measured.

```
layoutScroll
```

```
< motion . div layoutScroll style = { { overflow : "scroll" } } > < motion . div layout /> </ motion . div >
```

#### layoutRoot

```
layoutRoot
```

For layout animations to work correctly within position: fixed elements, we need to account for page scroll. Add layoutRoot to mark an element as position: fixed .

```
position: fixed
```

```
layoutRoot
```

```
position: fixed
```

```
< motion . div layoutRoot style = { { position : "fixed" } } > < motion . div layout /> </ motion . div >
```

#### onLayoutAnimationStart

```
onLayoutAnimationStart
```

A callback to run when a layout animation starts.

#### onLayoutAnimationComplete

```
onLayoutAnimationComplete
```

A callback to run when a layout animation completes.

### Advanced

#### inherit

```
inherit
```

Set to false to prevent a component inheriting or propagating changes in a parent variant.

```
false
```

#### custom

```
custom
```

Custom data to pass through to dynamic variants.

```
const variants = { visible : ( custom ) => ( { opacity : 1 , transition : { delay : custom * 0.2 } } ) } return ( < motion . ul animate = "visible" > < motion . li custom = { 0 } variants = { variants } /> < motion . li custom = { 1 } variants = { variants } /> < motion . li custom = { 2 } variants = { variants } /> </ motion . ul > )
```

#### transformTemplate

```
transformTemplate
```

By default, transforms are applied in order of translate , scale , rotate and skew .

```
translate
```

```
scale
```

```
rotate
```

```
skew
```

To change this, transformTemplate can be set as a function that accepts the latest transforms and the generated transform string and returns a new transform string.

```
transformTemplate
```

```
// Use the latest transform values < motion . div style = { { x : 0 , rotate : 180 } } transformTemplate = { ( { x , rotate } ) => `rotate( ${ rotate } deg) translateX( ${ x } px)` } />
```

```
// Or the generated transform string < motion . div style = { { x : 0 , rotate : 180 } } transformTemplate = { ( latest , generated ) => `translate(-50%, -50%) ${ generated } ` } />
```

## FAQs

What is the <motion /> component?

<motion /> is a drop-in replacement for HTML and SVG elements that adds animation capabilities. Instead of writing <div>, you write <motion.div>. The element behaves identically but can now accept animation props like animate, whileHover, and transition.

How do I animate an element in React with Motion?

Pass an animate prop to any <motion /> component with the values you want to animate to. For example, <motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} /> will animate opacity from its current value to 1. Motion automatically detects changes and animates between them.

Does <motion /> affect performance?

<motion /> is optimised to animate transform and opacity on the compositor thread wherever possible, avoiding layout and paint. For best performance, prefer animating transform and opacity over properties like width or top.

Can I use <motion /> with custom components?

Yes. Use motion.create() to wrap any component that forwards its ref and accepts a style prop. For example: const MotionButton = motion.create(Button).
