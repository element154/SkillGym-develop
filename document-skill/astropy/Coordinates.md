# Astronomical Coordinate Systems (`astropy.coordinates`

)#

## Introduction#

The `coordinates`

package provides classes for representing a variety
of celestial/spatial coordinates and their velocity components, as well as tools
for converting between common coordinate systems in a uniform way.

## Getting Started#

The best way to start using `coordinates`

is to use the `SkyCoord`

class. `SkyCoord`

objects are instantiated by passing in positions (and
optional velocities) with specified units and a coordinate frame. Sky positions
are commonly passed in as `Quantity`

objects and the frame is
specified with the string name.

To create a `SkyCoord`

object to represent an ICRS (Right ascension [RA],
Declination [Dec]) sky position:

```
>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
>>> c = SkyCoord(ra=10.625*u.degree, dec=41.2*u.degree, frame='icrs')
```

The initializer for `SkyCoord`

is very flexible and supports inputs provided in
a number of convenient formats. The following ways of initializing a coordinate
are all equivalent to the above:

```
>>> c = SkyCoord(10.625, 41.2, frame='icrs', unit='deg')
>>> c = SkyCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
>>> c = SkyCoord('00h42.5m', '+41d12m')
>>> c = SkyCoord('00 42 30 +41 12 00', unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg))
>>> c = SkyCoord('00:42.5 +41:12', unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg))
>>> c
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
(10.625, 41.2)>
```

The examples above illustrate a few rules to follow when creating a coordinate object:

Coordinate values can be provided either as unnamed positional arguments or via keyword arguments like

`ra`

and`dec`

, or`l`

and`b`

(depending on the frame).The coordinate

`frame`

keyword is optional because it defaults to`ICRS`

.Angle units must be specified for all components, either by passing in a

`Quantity`

object (e.g.,`10.5*u.degree`

), by including them in the value (e.g.,`'+41d12m00s'`

), or via the`unit`

keyword.

`SkyCoord`

and all other `coordinates`

objects also support
array coordinates. These work in the same way as single-value coordinates, but
they store multiple coordinates in a single object. When you are going
to apply the same operation to many different coordinates (say, from a
catalog), this is a better choice than a list of `SkyCoord`

objects,
because it will be *much* faster than applying the operation to each
`SkyCoord`

in a `for`

loop. Like the underlying `ndarray`

instances
that contain the data, `SkyCoord`

objects can be sliced, reshaped, etc.,
and can be used with functions like `numpy.moveaxis`

, etc., that affect the
shape:

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> c = SkyCoord(ra=[10, 11, 12, 13]*u.degree, dec=[41, -5, 42, 0]*u.degree)
>>> c
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
[(10., 41.), (11., -5.), (12., 42.), (13., 0.)]>
>>> c[1]
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
(11., -5.)>
>>> c.reshape(2, 2)
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
[[(10., 41.), (11., -5.)],
[(12., 42.), (13., 0.)]]>
>>> np.roll(c, 1)
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
[(13., 0.), (10., 41.), (11., -5.), (12., 42.)]>
```

### Coordinate Access#

Once you have a coordinate object you can access the components of that coordinate (e.g., RA, Dec) to get string representations of the full coordinate.

The component values are accessed using (typically lowercase) named attributes
that depend on the coordinate frame (e.g., ICRS, Galactic, etc.). For the
default, ICRS, the coordinate component names are `ra`

and `dec`

:

```
>>> c = SkyCoord(ra=10.68458*u.degree, dec=41.26917*u.degree)
>>> c.ra
<Longitude 10.68458 deg>
>>> c.ra.hour
np.float64(0.7123053333333335)
>>> c.ra.hms
hms_tuple(h=np.float64(0.0), m=np.float64(42.0), s=np.float64(44.299200000000525))
>>> c.dec
<Latitude 41.26917 deg>
>>> c.dec.degree
np.float64(41.26917)
>>> c.dec.radian
np.float64(0.7202828960652683)
```

Coordinates can be converted to strings using the
`to_string()`

method:

```
>>> c = SkyCoord(ra=10.68458*u.degree, dec=41.26917*u.degree)
>>> c.to_string('decimal')
'10.6846 41.2692'
>>> c.to_string('dms')
'10d41m04.488s 41d16m09.012s'
>>> c.to_string('hmsdms')
'00h42m44.2992s +41d16m09.012s'
```

For additional information see the section on Working with Angles.

### Transformation#

One convenient way to transform to a new coordinate frame is by accessing the appropriately named attribute.

To get the coordinate in the `Galactic`

frame use:

```
>>> c_icrs = SkyCoord(ra=10.68458*u.degree, dec=41.26917*u.degree, frame='icrs')
>>> c_icrs.galactic
<SkyCoord (Galactic): (l, b) in deg
(121.17424181, -21.57288557)>
```

For more control, you can use the `transform_to`

method, which accepts a frame name, frame class, or frame instance:

```
>>> c_fk5 = c_icrs.transform_to('fk5') # c_icrs.fk5 does the same thing
>>> c_fk5
<SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J2000.000): (ra, dec) in deg
(10.68459154, 41.26917146)>
>>> from astropy.coordinates import FK5
>>> c_fk5.transform_to(FK5(equinox='J1975')) # precess to a different equinox
<SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J1975.000): (ra, dec) in deg
(10.34209135, 41.13232112)>
```

This form of `transform_to`

also makes it
possible to convert from celestial coordinates to
`AltAz`

coordinates, allowing the use of `SkyCoord`

as a tool for planning observations. For a more complete example of
this, see Determining and plotting the altitude/azimuth of a celestial object.

Some coordinate frames such as `AltAz`

require Earth
rotation information (UT1-UTC offset and/or polar motion) when transforming
to/from other frames. These Earth rotation values are automatically downloaded
from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) service when
required. See IERS data access (astropy.utils.iers) for details of this process.

### Representation#

So far we have been using a spherical coordinate representation in all of our
examples, and this is the default for the built-in frames. Frequently it is
convenient to initialize or work with a coordinate using a different
representation such as Cartesian or Cylindrical. This can be done by setting
the `representation_type`

for either `SkyCoord`

objects or low-level frame
coordinate objects.

To initialize or work with a coordinate using a different representation such as Cartesian or Cylindrical:

```
>>> c = SkyCoord(x=1, y=2, z=3, unit='kpc', representation_type='cartesian')
>>> c
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (x, y, z) in kpc
(1., 2., 3.)>
>>> c.x, c.y, c.z
(<Quantity 1. kpc>, <Quantity 2. kpc>, <Quantity 3. kpc>)
>>> c.representation_type = 'cylindrical'
>>> c
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (rho, phi, z) in (kpc, deg, kpc)
(2.23606798, 63.43494882, 3.)>
```

For all of the details see Representations.

### Distance#

`SkyCoord`

and the individual frame classes also support specifying a distance
from the frame origin. The origin depends on the particular coordinate frame;
this can be, for example, centered on the earth, centered on the solar system
barycenter, etc.

Two angles and a distance specify a unique point in 3D space, which also allows converting the coordinates to a Cartesian representation:

```
>>> c = SkyCoord(ra=10.68458*u.degree, dec=41.26917*u.degree, distance=770*u.kpc)
>>> c.cartesian.x
<Quantity 568.71286542 kpc>
>>> c.cartesian.y
<Quantity 107.3008974 kpc>
>>> c.cartesian.z
<Quantity 507.88994292 kpc>
```

With distances assigned, `SkyCoord`

convenience methods are more powerful, as
they can make use of the 3D information. For example, to compute the physical,
3D separation between two points in space:

```
>>> c1 = SkyCoord(ra=10*u.degree, dec=9*u.degree, distance=10*u.pc, frame='icrs')
>>> c2 = SkyCoord(ra=11*u.degree, dec=10*u.degree, distance=11.5*u.pc, frame='icrs')
>>> c1.separation_3d(c2)
<Distance 1.52286024 pc>
```

### Convenience Methods#

`SkyCoord`

defines a number of convenience methods that support, for example,
computing on-sky (i.e., angular) and 3D separations between two coordinates.

To compute on-sky and 3D separations between two coordinates:

```
>>> c1 = SkyCoord(ra=10*u.degree, dec=9*u.degree, frame='icrs')
>>> c2 = SkyCoord(ra=11*u.degree, dec=10*u.degree, frame='fk5')
>>> c1.separation(c2) # Differing frames handled correctly
<Angle 1.40453359 deg>
```

Or cross-matching catalog coordinates (detailed in Matching Catalogs):

```
>>> target_c = SkyCoord(ra=10*u.degree, dec=9*u.degree, frame='icrs')
>>> # read in coordinates from a catalog...
>>> catalog_c = ...
>>> idx, sep, _ = target_c.match_to_catalog_sky(catalog_c)
```

The `astropy.coordinates`

sub-package also provides a quick way to get
coordinates for named objects, assuming you have an active internet
connection. The `from_name`

method of `SkyCoord`

uses Sesame to retrieve coordinates
for a particular named object.

To retrieve coordinates for a particular named object:

```
>>> SkyCoord.from_name("PSR J1012+5307")
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
(153.1393271, 53.117343)>
```

In some cases, the coordinates are embedded in the catalog name of the object.
For such object names, `from_name`

is able
to parse the coordinates from the name if given the `parse=True`

option.
For slow connections, this may be much faster than a sesame query for the same
object name. It’s worth noting, however, that the coordinates extracted in this
way may differ from the database coordinates by a few deci-arcseconds, so only
use this option if you do not need sub-arcsecond accuracy for your coordinates:

```
>>> SkyCoord.from_name("CRTS SSS100805 J194428-420209", parse=True)
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
(296.11666667, -42.03583333)>
```

For sites (primarily observatories) on the Earth, `astropy.coordinates`

provides
a quick way to get an `EarthLocation`

- the
`of_site()`

classmethod:

```
>>> from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation
>>> apo = EarthLocation.of_site('Apache Point Observatory')
>>> apo
<EarthLocation (-1463969.30185172, -5166673.34223433, 3434985.71204565) m>
```

To see the list of site names available, use
`get_site_names()`

:

```
>>> EarthLocation.get_site_names()
['ALMA', 'AO', 'ARCA', ...]
```

Both `of_site()`

and
`get_site_names()`

,
`astropy.coordinates`

attempt to access the site registry from the
astropy-data repository and will
save the registry in the user’s local cache (see Downloadable Data Management (astropy.utils.data)).
The cached version of the site registry is not updated automatically,
but the latest version may be downloaded using the `refresh_cache=True`

option of these methods. If you would like a site to be added to the registry,
issue a pull request to the astropy-data repository.

For arbitrary Earth addresses (e.g., not observatory sites), use the
`of_address()`

classmethod to retrieve
the latitude and longitude. This works with fully specified addresses, location
names, city names, etc:

```
>>> EarthLocation.of_address('1002 Holy Grail Court, St. Louis, MO')
<EarthLocation (-26769.86528679, -4997007.71191864, 3950273.57633915) m>
```

By default the OpenStreetMap Nominatim service is used, but by providing a
Google Geocoding API key with
the `google_api_key`

argument it is possible to use Google Maps instead. It
is also possible to query the height of the location in addition to its
longitude and latitude, but only with the Google queries:

```
>>> EarthLocation.of_address("Cape Town", get_height=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Currently, `get_height` only works when using the Google
geocoding API...
```

Note

`from_name()`

,
`of_site()`

, and
`of_address()`

are designed for
convenience, not accuracy. If you need accurate coordinates for an
object you should find the appropriate reference and input the coordinates
manually, or use more specialized functionality like that in the astroquery or astroplan affiliated packages.

Also note that these methods retrieve data from the internet to determine the celestial or geographic coordinates. The online data may be updated, so if you need to guarantee that your scripts are reproducible in the long term, see the Usage Tips/Suggestions for Methods That Access Remote Resources section.

This functionality can be combined to do more complicated tasks like computing
barycentric corrections to radial velocity observations (also a supported
high-level `SkyCoord`

method - see Radial Velocity Corrections):

```
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> obstime = Time('2017-2-14')
>>> target = SkyCoord.from_name('M31')
>>> keck = EarthLocation.of_site('Keck')
>>> target.radial_velocity_correction(obstime=obstime, location=keck).to('km/s')
<Quantity -22.359784554780255 km / s>
```

While `astropy.coordinates`

does not natively support converting an Earth
location to a timezone, the longitude and latitude can be retrieved from any
`EarthLocation`

object, which could then be passed to any
third-party package that supports timezone solving, such as timezonefinder, in which case you might have to
pass in their `.degree`

attributes.

The resulting timezone name could then be used with any packages that support time zone definitions, such as the zoneinfo:

```
>>> import datetime
>>> from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
>>> tz = ZoneInfo('America/Phoenix')
>>> dt = datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 12, 20, 0, 0, tzinfo=tz)
```

### Velocities (Proper Motions and Radial Velocities)#

In addition to positional coordinates, `coordinates`

supports storing
and transforming velocities. These are available both via the lower-level
coordinate frame classes, and via `SkyCoord`

objects:

```
>>> sc = SkyCoord(1*u.deg, 2*u.deg, radial_velocity=20*u.km/u.s)
>>> sc
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
(1., 2.)
(radial_velocity) in km / s
(20.,)>
```

For more details on velocity support (and limitations), see the Working with Velocities in Astropy Coordinates page.

### Masks#

Sometimes you may have incomplete information about objects, e.g., some have
distances while others have not. `coordinates`

supports using masks
for such purposes, using the `Masked`

class:

```
>>> from astropy.utils.masked import Masked
>>> distance = Masked([0.1, np.nan]*u.kpc, mask=[False, True])
>>> sc = SkyCoord([1., 2.]*u.hourangle, [3., 4.]*u.deg, distance=distance)
>>> sc
<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, kpc)
[(15., 3., 0.1), (30., 4., ———)]>
```

The masks propagates as you would expect:

```
>>> sc.separation(sc[0])
<MaskedAngle [ 0. , 15.00502838] deg>
>>> sc.separation_3d(sc[0])
<MaskedDistance [ 0., ———] kpc>
>>> gcrs = sc.gcrs
RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in ld...
RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in anp...
>>> gcrs
<SkyCoord (GCRS: obstime=J2000.000, obsgeoloc=(0., 0., 0.) m, obsgeovel=(0., 0., 0.) m / s): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, kpc)
[(15.00054403, 2.99988395, 0.1), ( ———, ———, ———)]>
```

In the last example, you will notice that the angles of the second item have
become masked too. This is because the distance is required in the conversion.
Indeed, because we put in `NaN`

, we get not only the warnings during
the conversion, but also `NaN`

in the unmasked converted angles:

```
>>> gcrs.unmasked
<SkyCoord (GCRS: obstime=J2000.000, obsgeoloc=(0., 0., 0.) m, obsgeovel=(0., 0., 0.) m / s): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, kpc)
[(15.00054403, 2.99988395, 0.1), ( nan, nan, nan)]>
```

In principle, by using a “good guess” for the distance, this can be avoided:

```
>>> distance2 = Masked([0.1, 1.]*u.kpc, mask=[False, True])
>>> sc2 = SkyCoord([1., 2.]*u.hourangle, [3., 4.]*u.deg, distance=distance2)
>>> gcrs2 = sc2.gcrs
>>> gcrs2
<SkyCoord (GCRS: obstime=J2000.000, obsgeoloc=(0., 0., 0.) m, obsgeovel=(0., 0., 0.) m / s): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, kpc)
[(15.00054403, 2.99988395, 0.1), ( ———, ———, ———)]>
>>> gcrs2.unmasked
<SkyCoord (GCRS: obstime=J2000.000, obsgeoloc=(0., 0., 0.) m, obsgeovel=(0., 0., 0.) m / s): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, kpc)
[(15.00054403, 2.99988395, 0.1), (30.00201927, 3.99996188, 1. )]>
```

Warning

Support for masks is new in astropy 7.0, and likely incomplete. Please report any problems you find.

## Overview of `astropy.coordinates`

Concepts#

Note

More detailed information and justification of the design is available in APE (Astropy Proposal for Enhancement) 5.

Here we provide an overview of the package and associated framework.
This background information is not necessary for using `coordinates`

,
particularly if you use the `SkyCoord`

high-level class, but it is helpful for
more advanced usage, particularly creating your own frame, transformations, or
representations. Another useful piece of background information are some
Important Definitions as they are used in
`coordinates`

.

`coordinates`

is built on a three-tiered system of objects:
representations, frames, and a high-level class. Representations
classes are a particular way of storing a three-dimensional data point
(or points), such as Cartesian coordinates or spherical polar
coordinates. Frames are particular reference frames like FK5 or ICRS,
which may store their data in different representations, but have
well-defined transformations between each other. These transformations are
all stored in the `astropy.coordinates.frame_transform_graph`

, and new
transformations can be created by users. Finally, the high-level class
(`SkyCoord`

) uses the frame classes, but provides a more accessible
interface to these objects as well as various convenience methods and
more string-parsing capabilities.

Separating these concepts makes it easier to extend the functionality of
`coordinates`

. It allows representations, frames, and
transformations to be defined or extended separately, while still
preserving the high-level capabilities and ease-of-use of the `SkyCoord`

class.

In addition, another resource for the capabilities of this package is the
`astropy.coordinates.tests.test_api_ape5`

testing file. It showcases most of
the major capabilities of the package, and hence is a useful supplement to
this document. You can see it by either downloading a copy of the Astropy
source code, or typing the following in an IPython session:

```
In [1]: from astropy.coordinates.tests import test_api_ape5
In [2]: test_api_ape5??
```

## Performance Tips#

If you are using `SkyCoord`

for many different coordinates, you will see much
better performance if you create a single `SkyCoord`

with arrays of coordinates
as opposed to creating individual `SkyCoord`

objects for each individual
coordinate:

```
>>> coord = SkyCoord(ra_array, dec_array, unit='deg')
```

Frame attributes can be arrays too, as long as the coordinate data and all of the frame attributes have shapes that are compatible according to Numpy broadcasting rules:

```
>>> coord = FK4(1 * u.deg, 2 * u.deg, obstime=["J2000", "J2001"])
>>> coord.shape
(2,)
```

In addition, looping over a `SkyCoord`

object can be slow. If you need to
transform the coordinates to a different frame, it is much faster to transform a
single `SkyCoord`

with arrays of values as opposed to looping over the
`SkyCoord`

and transforming them individually.

Finally, for more advanced users, note that you can use broadcasting to
transform `SkyCoord`

objects into frames with vector properties.

To use broadcasting to transform `SkyCoord`

objects into frames with vector
properties:

```
>>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord, EarthLocation
>>> from astropy import coordinates as coord
>>> from astropy.coordinates import golden_spiral_grid
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> import numpy as np
>>> # 1000 locations in a grid on the sky
>>> coos = SkyCoord(golden_spiral_grid(size=1000))
>>> # 300 times over the space of 10 hours
>>> times = Time.now() + np.linspace(-5, 5, 300)*u.hour
>>> # note the use of broadcasting so that 300 times are broadcast against 1000 positions
>>> lapalma = EarthLocation.from_geocentric(5327448.9957829, -1718665.73869569, 3051566.90295403, unit='m')
>>> aa_frame = coord.AltAz(obstime=times[:, np.newaxis], location=lapalma)
>>> # calculate alt-az of each object at each time.
>>> aa_coos = coos.transform_to(aa_frame)
```

### Broadcasting Over Frame Data and Attributes#

Frames in `astropy.coordinates`

support
Numpy broadcasting rules over both
frame data and frame attributes. This makes it easy and fast to do positional
astronomy calculations and transformations on sweeps of parameters.

Where this really shines is doing fast observability calculations over arrays.
The following example constructs an `EarthLocation`

array
of length

, a *L*`SkyCoord`

array of length

, and a *M*`Time`

array of length `N`

. It uses
Numpy broadcasting rules to evaluate a boolean array of shape
`(`

that is *L*, *M*, *N*)`True`

for those observing locations, times,
and sky coordinates, for which the target is above an altitude limit:

```
>>> from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation, AltAz, SkyCoord
>>> from astropy.coordinates.angles import uniform_spherical_random_surface
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> import numpy as np
>>> L = 25
>>> M = 100
>>> N = 50
>>> # Earth locations of length L
>>> c = uniform_spherical_random_surface(L)
>>> locations = EarthLocation.from_geodetic(c.lon, c.lat)
>>> # Celestial coordinates of length M
>>> coords = SkyCoord(uniform_spherical_random_surface(M))
>>> # Observation times of length N
>>> obstimes = Time('2023-08-04') + np.linspace(0, 24, N) * u.hour
>>> # AltAz coordinates of shape (L, M, N)
>>> frame = AltAz(
... location=locations[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis],
... obstime=obstimes[np.newaxis, np.newaxis, :])
>>> altaz = coords[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis].transform_to(frame)
>>> min_altitude = 30 * u.deg
>>> is_above_altitude_limit = (altaz.alt > min_altitude)
>>> is_above_altitude_limit.shape
(25, 100, 50)
```

### Improving Performance for Arrays of `obstime`

#

The most expensive operations when transforming between observer-dependent coordinate
frames (e.g. `AltAz`

) and sky-fixed frames (e.g. `ICRS`

) are the calculation
of the orientation and position of Earth.

If `SkyCoord`

instances are transformed for a large number of closely spaced `obstime`

,
these calculations can be sped up by factors up to 100, whilst still keeping micro-arcsecond precision,
by utilizing interpolation instead of calculating Earth orientation parameters for each individual point.

To use interpolation for the astrometric values in coordinate transformation, use:

```
>>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord, EarthLocation, AltAz
>>> from astropy.coordinates.erfa_astrom import erfa_astrom, ErfaAstromInterpolator
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> from time import perf_counter
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import astropy.units as u
>>> # array with 10000 obstimes
>>> obstime = Time('2010-01-01T20:00') + np.linspace(0, 6, 10000) * u.hour
>>> location = EarthLocation(lon=-17.89 * u.deg, lat=28.76 * u.deg, height=2200 * u.m)
>>> frame = AltAz(obstime=obstime, location=location)
>>> crab = SkyCoord(ra='05h34m31.94s', dec='22d00m52.2s')
>>> # transform with default transformation and print duration

Here, we look into choosing an appropriate `time_resolution`

.
We will transform a single sky coordinate for lots of observation times from
`ICRS`

to `AltAz`

and evaluate precision and runtime for different values
for `time_resolution`

compared to the non-interpolating, default approach.

## Built-in Frames and Transformations#

The diagram below shows all of the built in coordinate systems, their aliases (useful for converting other coordinates to them using attribute-style access) and the pre-defined transformations between them. The user is free to override any of these transformations by defining new transformations between these systems, but the pre-defined transformations should be sufficient for typical usage.

The color of an edge in the graph (i.e., the transformations between two frames) is set by the type of transformation; the legend box defines the mapping from transform class name to color.
